For instance, the influential textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Russell & Norvig) describes:\\n\\nAgent: Anything that perceives its environment (using sensors) and acts upon it (using actuators). E.g., a robot with cameras and wheels, or a software program that reads data and makes recommendations.\\nRational Agent: An agent that strives to achieve the *best possible outcome* based on its knowledge and past experiences. \"Best\" is defined by a performance measure – a way of evaluating how well the agent is doing.\\nArtificial Intelligence (as a field): The study and creation of these rational agents.\\nOther researchers and definitions build upon this foundation. Padgham & Winikoff emphasize that intelligent agents should react to changes in their environment in a timely way, proactively pursue goals, and be flexible and robust (able to handle unexpected situations). Some also suggest that ideal agents should be \"rational\" in the economic sense (making optimal choices) and capable of complex reasoning, like having beliefs, desires, and intentions (BDI model). Kaplan and Haenlein offer a similar definition, focusing on a system\\'s ability to understand external data, learn from that data, and use what is learned to achieve goals through flexible adaptation.\\nDefining AI in terms of intelligent agents offers several key advantages:\\n\\nAvoids Philosophical Debates: It sidesteps arguments about whether AI is \"truly\" intelligent or conscious, like those raised by the Turing test or Searle\\'s Chinese Room. It focuses on behavior and goal achievement, not on replicating human thought.\\nObjective Testing: It provides a clear, scientific way to evaluate AI systems.

It addresses the challenge of information silos and legacy systems that constrain even the most sophisticated AI models.\\nAnthropic introduced MCP to address the growing complexity of integrating LLMs with third-party systems. Before MCP, developers often had to build custom connectors for each data source or tool, resulting in what Anthropic described as an \"N×M\" data integration problem.\\nEarlier stop-gap approaches - such as OpenAI’s 2023 “function-calling” API and the ChatGPT plug-in framework - solved similar problems but required vendor-specific connectors. MCP’s authors note that the protocol deliberately re-uses the message-flow ideas of the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and is transported over JSON-RPC 2.0.\\nMCP was designed as a response to this challenge, offering a universal protocol for interfacing any AI assistant with any structured tool or data layer. The protocol was released with software development kits (SDK) in multiple programming languages, including Python, TypeScript, Java, and C#.\\n\\n\\n== Features ==\\n\\nMCP defines a set of specifications for:\\n\\nData ingestion and transformation\\nContextual metadata tagging\\nModel interoperability across platforms\\nSecure, two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered tools\\nThe protocol enables developers to either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.

In 2010, Jonathan Ellis and Matt Pfeil left Rackspace, where they had worked with Cassandra, to launch Riptano in Austin, Texas. Ellis and Pfeil later renamed the company DataStax, and moved its headquarters to Santa Clara, California.\\nThe company went on to create its own enterprise version of Cassandra, a NoSQL database called DataStax Enterprise (DSE).\\nIn 2019, Chet Kapoor was named the company's new CEO, taking over from Billy Bosworth.\\n\\nIn May 2020, DataStax released Astra DB, a DBaaS for Cassandra applications. In November 2020, DataStax released K8ssandra, an open source distribution of Cassandra on Kubernetes. In December 2020, DataStax released Stargate, an open source data API gateway.\\nAfter acquiring streaming event vendor Kesque in January 2021, the company launched Luna Streaming, a data streaming platform for Apache Pulsar.

Astra Streaming can connect to a larger data platform by utilizing DataStax's Astra DB cloud service.\\nStarting in 2023, DataStax began incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning into its platform. In January 2023, the company acquired Kaskada, developer of a platform that helps organizations use data for AI applications. DataStax made the formerly proprietary Kaskada technology open source, and integrated it into its Luna ML service, which was launched on May 4, 2023.

For example, when Google first demonstrated its LLM tool \"Google Bard\", the LLM provided incorrect information about the James Webb Space Telescope. This error contributed to a $100 billion decline in the company’s stock value. RAG is used to prevent these errors, but it does not solve all the problems. For example, LLMs can generate misinformation even when pulling from factually correct sources if they misinterpret the context. MIT Technology Review gives the example of an AI-generated response stating, \"The United States has had one Muslim president, Barack Hussein Obama.\" The model retrieved this from an academic book rhetorically titled Barack Hussein Obama: America’s First Muslim President? The LLM did not \"know\" or \"understand\" the context of the title, generating a false statement.\\nLLMs with RAG are programmed to prioritize new information. This technique has been called \"prompt stuffing.\" Without \"prompt stuffing\", the LLM\\'s input is generated by a user; with prompt stuff, additional relevant context is added to this input to guide the model’s response. This approach provides the LLM with key information early in the prompt, encouraging it to prioritize the supplied data over pre-existing training knowledge.\\n\\n\\n== Process ==\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating an information-retrieval mechanism that allows models to access and utilize additional data beyond their original training set. AWS states, \"RAG allows LLMs to retrieve relevant information from external data sources to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses\" (indexing). This approach reduces reliance on static datasets, which can quickly become outdated. When a user submits a query, RAG uses a document retriever to search for relevant content from available sources before incorporating the retrieved information into the model’s response (retrieval). Ars Technica notes that \"when new information becomes available, rather than having to retrain the model, all that’s needed is to augment the model’s external knowledge base with the updated information\" (augmentation). By dynamically integrating relevant data, RAG enables LLMs to generate more informed and contextually grounded responses (generation).

LangChain for instance utilizes sentence transformers for purposes of indexing documents. In particular, an indexing is generated by generating embeddings for chunks of documents and storing (document chunk, embedding) tuples. Then given a query in natural language, the embedding for the query can be generated. A top k similarity search algorithm is then used between the query embedding and the document chunk embeddings to retrieve the most relevant document chunks as context information for question answering tasks. This approach is also known formally as retrieval-augmented generation\\nThough not as predominant as BERTScore, sentence embeddings are commonly used for sentence similarity evaluation which sees common use for the task of optimizing a Large language model's generation parameters is often performed via comparing candidate sentences against reference sentences.

In simpler terms, it is a process for which predictions can be made regarding future outcomes based solely on its present state and—most importantly—such predictions are just as good as the ones that could be made knowing the process\\'s full history. In other words, conditional on the present state of the system, its future and past states are independent.\\nA Markov chain is a type of Markov process that has either a discrete state space or a discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, it is common to define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless of the nature of time), but it is also common to define a Markov chain as having discrete time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).\\n\\n\\n=== Types of Markov chains ===\\nThe system\\'s state space and time parameter index need to be specified. The following table gives an overview of the different instances of Markov processes for different levels of state space generality and for discrete time v. continuous time:\\n\\nNote that there is no definitive agreement in the literature on the use of some of the terms that signify special cases of Markov processes. Usually the term \"Markov chain\" is reserved for a process with a discrete set of times, that is, a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), but a few authors use the term \"Markov process\" to refer to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) without explicit mention. In addition, there are other extensions of Markov processes that are referred to as such but do not necessarily fall within any of these four categories (see Markov model). Moreover, the time index need not necessarily be real-valued; like with the state space, there are conceivable processes that move through index sets with other mathematical constructs. Notice that the general state space continuous-time Markov chain is general to such a degree that it has no designated term.\\nWhile the time parameter is usually discrete, the state space of a Markov chain does not have any generally agreed-on restrictions: the term may refer to a process on an arbitrary state space. However, many applications of Markov chains employ finite or countably infinite state spaces, which have a more straightforward statistical analysis. Besides time-index and state-space parameters, there are many other variations, extensions and generalizations (see Variations). For simplicity, most of this article concentrates on the discrete-time, discrete state-space case, unless mentioned otherwise.\\n\\n\\n=== Transitions ===\\nThe changes '), Document(metadata={'title': 'List of supermarket chains in Germany', 'summary': 'This is a list of current German supermarket chains.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_supermarket_chains_in_Germany'}, page_content='This is a list of current German supermarket chains.\\n\\n\\n== German supermarket chains ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nList of supermarket chains\\nList of supermarket chains in Europe\\nIndian grocery online in Germany\\n\\n\\n== References =='), Document(metadata={'title': 'List of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson episodes', 'summary': \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson is an American late-night talk show that aired weeknights at 12:37 am (Los Angeles time) on CBS in the United States from January 3, 2005, to December 19, 2014.

One generally accepted route by which fungi make itaconate is through the tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway. This pathway forms cis-aconitate which is converted to itaconate by cis-aconitate-decarboxylase. Animal cells also make itaconate by an enzyme-catalyzed reaction from cis-aconitate, an intermediate metabolite in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, (i.e., TCA cycle). The itaconate-producing reaction is stimulated when the TCA cycle is suppressed. \\nUstilago maydis  makes itaconic acid from trans-aconitate, catalyzed by aconitate delta-isomerase. The trans-aconitate product is decarboxylated to itaconate by trans-aconitate decarboxylase (i.e., TAD1, an enzyme found in Ustilago maydis) Itaconate has also been obtained by fermenting the fungi Yarrowia lipolytica with glucose, various species of Candida fungi with glucose, Ustilago vetiveriae fungus with glycerol, and various species of Aspergillus niger fungi with glucose, sorbitol, or sorbitol plus xylose mixture. Fermenting Escherichia coli bacteria with glucose, xylose, glycerol, or starch and Corynebacterium glutamicum bacteria with glucose or urea also affords itaconic acid.  Ustilago maydis has, however, been genetically engineered to increase its itaconic acid production,\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nIn the 1930s itaconate was shown to have bactericidal actions.  In 2011, Strelko et al. reported that itaconate was produced by two mammalian immortalized cell lines, cultured mouse VM-M3 brain tumor cells and RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages, and by macrophages isolated from mice. This group also showed that stimulation of mouse macrophages with the bacterial toxin, lipopolysaccharide (i.e., LPS, also termed endotoxin), increased their production and secretion of itaconate. In 2013, Michelucci et al. revealed the biosynthesis pathway that makes itaconate in mammals. These publications were followed by numerous others focused on the biology of itaconate and certain itaconate-like compounds as regulars of various cellular responses in animals and possibly humans.\\n\\n\\n== Biology of Itaconate ==\\nBiological studies focus on itaconate's physiological and pathological functions. \\n\\n\\n=== Cells making itaconate ===\\nThe major cell types that normally make itaconate in response to stressful conditions are hematological cells such as the macrophages located in various tissues and the monocytes located in the bone marrow and blood. These cells are phagocytes, i.e., cells that ingulf microorganisms, dead or seriously injured cells, and foreign particles all of which cause inflammatory responses. Itaconate is also produced by certain myeloid-derived suppressor \"), Document(metadata={'title': 'List of German films of the 1990s', 'summary': 'This is a list of the most notable films produced in Cinema of Germany in the 1990s.\\nFor an alphabetical list of articles on German films see Category:1990s German films.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German_films_of_the_1990s'}, page_content='This is a list of the most notable films produced in Cinema of Germany in the 1990s.\\nFor an alphabetical list of articles on German films see Category:1990s German films.\\n\\n\\n== 1990 ==\\n\\n\\n== 1991 ==\\n\\n\\n== 1992 ==\\n\\n\\n== 1993 ==\\n\\n\\n== 1994 ==\\n\\n\\n== 1995 ==\\n\\n\\n== 1996 ==\\n\\n\\n== 1997 ==\\n\\n\\n== 1998 ==\\n\\n\\n== 1999 ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nGerman film at the Internet Movie Database (maintains separate lists for West Germany and East Germany)'), Document(metadata={'title': 'List of festivals in the Philippines', 'summary': 'The origin of most early festivals, locally known as \"fiestas\", are rooted in Christianity, dating back to the Spanish colonial period when the many communities (such as barrios and towns) of the predominantly Catholic Philippines almost always had a patron saint assigned to each of them.

In 2005, researchers showed that the common practice of using a mother\\'s maiden name as the basis for a stage name could be exploited to entice people to reveal that name and other details that could allow fraudsters to steal their identities. Researchers asked a random sample of people on London streets a series of questions, beginning with \"What is your name?\" They then engaged in conversation about theatre, asked people if they knew how actors choose their stage names, then told them that stage names were typically a combination of the name of a pet and the mother\\'s maiden name.
